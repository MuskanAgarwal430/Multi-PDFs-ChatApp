# Multi-PDF-s 📚ChatApp AI Agent 🤖

Meet MultiPDF Chat AI App! 🚀 Chat seamlessly with Multiple PDFs using Langchain, Google Gemini Pro &amp; FAISS Vector DB with Seamless Streamlit Deployment. Get instant, Accurate responses from Awesome Google Gemini OpenSource language Model. 📚💬 Transform your PDF experience now! 🔥✨

## 📝 Description
The Multi-PDF's Chat Agent is a Streamlit-based web application designed to facilitate interactive conversations with a chatbot. The app allows users to upload multiple PDF documents, extract text information from them, and train a chatbot using this extracted content. Users can then engage in real-time conversations with the chatbot.

## 🎯 How It Works:
------------

![MultiPDF Chat App Diagram](img/Architecture.jpg)

The application follows these steps to provide responses to your questions:

1. **PDF Loading** : The app reads multiple PDF documents and extracts their text content.

2. **Text Chunking** : The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks that can be processed effectively.

3. **Language Model** : The application utilizes a language model to generate vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks.

4. **Similarity Matching** : When you ask a question, the app compares it with the text chunks and identifies the most semantically similar ones.

5. **Response Generation** : The selected chunks are passed to the language model, which generates a response based on the relevant content of the PDFs.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Adaptive Chunking**: Our Sliding Window Chunking technique dynamically adjusts window size and position for RAG, balancing fine-grained and coarse-grained data access based on data complexity and context.

- **Multi-Document Conversational QA**: Supports simple and multi-hop queries across multiple documents simultaneously, breaking the single-document limitation.

- **File Compatibility**: Supports both PDF and TXT file formats.

- **LLM Model Compatibility**: Supports Google Gemini Pro, OpenAI GPT 3, Anthropic Claude, Llama2 and other open-source LLMs.

## 🌟Requirements

- **Streamlit** : A Python library for building web applications with interactive elements.
- **google-generativeai** : It is a package that provides generative AI capabilities for chatbots and virtual agents. It can be used in a variety of applications such as content generation, dialogue agents, summarization and classification systems and more.
- **python-dotenv** : A library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file. This is commonly used to store configuration settings, API keys, and other sensitive information outside of your code.
- **langchain** : A custom library for natural language processing tasks, including conversational retrieval, text splitting, embeddings, vector stores, chat models, and memory.
- **PyPDF2** : PyPDF2 is a library for reading and manipulating PDF files in Python. It can be used to merge, split, and modify PDFs. In the context of a multipdf chatbot, PyPDF2 could be used to handle the manipulation and generation of PDF files based on user input or responses.
- **faiss-cpu** : FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library developed by Facebook for efficient similarity search, Machine Learning Embeddings,Information Retrieval, content-based filtering and clustering of dense vectors.
- **langchain_google_genai** : It is a package that provides an integration between LangChain and Google’s generative-ai SDK. It contains classes that extend the Embeddings class and provide methods for generating embeddings. The package can be used in a multipdf chatbot application to extract textual data from PDF documents and generate Accurate responses to user queries.
